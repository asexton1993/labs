[Dima Starodubcev](https://steemit.com/@hipster)

Working Draft

## Abstract
cyber•Rating: Crypto Property Evaluation. One year ago we research a ways of . Implementation was limited for a system with a relatively cheap
It become obvious that in order to solve an issue of

In this white paper we describe approach used in cyber•Fund application that is build based on cyber•Chain lazy oracles and dynamic snippets in order to solve issues

## Lessons learned from cyber•Rating

*Measuring instead of Reporting*.

## Block indexing

## Transaction indexing

## Balance calculation

## Token valuation

## Token rating

## Token description

## Crowdsale tracking

## Identity crawling

## Economic Model
Basic application model is based on the assumption that it will be able to produce value for cyber•Chain network and effectively get market share in the reward pool.
- Operating as 1 of 21 witnesses it will be able to get ~0.23%
- Acting as longterm investor. Initially up-to 5% of cyber•Chain network will be in possession of cyber•Fund. Thus we can expect that 0.25% of reward pool can be acquired by the fact of long term holding of CYBER.
- Acting as reporter of blocks and transactions. Cyber•Fund is going to create indexers for any popular blockchain technology. Assume - 0,5%
- Acting as auditor of the blockchain data submitted by anybody. Curation can bring up to 2% of future reward pool.
- Every balance indexed by cyber•Fund relayers will be linked to dynamic snippets that answer questions on addresses balance, history and valuation. Let us suppose that such snippets will be able to acquire about 1% of reward pool through this actions.
- Acting as beneficiary for user actions. 5% of the network actions bring cyber•Fund additional revenue 0.2% of reward pool.

Thus it is possible to acquire up to 5% of cyber•Chain reward pool. This revenue is not guarantee and need to stay competitive to keep share of cyber•Chain reward pool. Let us assume that capitalization of cyber•Chain will $ 10 million. Thus cyber•Fund application will be able to generate about $50k dollars per year. If cyber•Chain capitalization increase up to $100 million revenue of cyber•Fund application increase proportionally. Worth to note that it is hard to predict the growth of app's revenue because it depends on cyber•Chain capitalization and growth.

In order to operate cyber•Fund should invest $25k in high performant witness node and spend about $5k in a year to support it. Also it should pay for ever going development of relayers for lazy oracles and dynamic snippets. 10 millions of cyber•Chain capitalization allow to invest in 3 full time developers without possible extended revenue sources.

Business model can be extended with the following payed services paid in different:
